    "At widget factory, the machines produce about 5 percent defective widgets even when properly adjusted. The widgets are then packed in crates containing 1900 widgets each. A crate is examined and found to contain 115 defective widgets. What is the approximate probability of finding at least this many defective widgets if the machine is properly adjusted?"

    "In an opinion poll it is assumed that an unknown proportion p of the people are in favor of a proposed new law and a proportion 1 − p are against it. A sample of n people is taken to obtain their opinion. The proportion ¯p in favor in the sample is taken as an estimate of p. Using the Central Limit Theorem, determine how large a sample will ensure that the estimate will, with probability .95, be correct to within .01."
