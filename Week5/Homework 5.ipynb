For example, if you have x, y, and z, but y and z are highly correlated, then you can easily just work with x and y for clustering purposes. Use the `PCA` library to reduce your data to two dimensions. Create a 2D scatterplot to verify it worked. Then use `KMeans` to cluster the reduced data. Does it work? Comment on what you see."
